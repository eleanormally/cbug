# File Purpose
To save information about building commands

`docker build -t elearnmally/cpp-memory-debugger:tag - < Dockerfile`
`go build -buildmode cbug.go`

make sure to update release info, and also to move executable to release folder


using ./build.sh very useful. Just set version number, and make sure a folder with that version as its name is provided
