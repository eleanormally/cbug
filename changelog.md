v1.1.0:
 - added forcable x86 and arm, no matter the platform (so arm can emulate an x86 environ and vice versa)
 - added builds for cross platform and cross architecture
 - added notarization for macos builds 
 - fixed upgrade command not properly checking docker hub


 notes on v1.1.0:
 looking to figure out a better way to do installs. DMG requires a paid dev account
